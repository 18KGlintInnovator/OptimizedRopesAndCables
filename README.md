<h3>Future goals (in no particular order)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Mesh Generation.</li>
<li>Accurate curve based on a mass hanging in the middle.</li>
<li>Ground Detection.</li>
<li>Cutting Rope at some point (runtime)</li>
<li>Spring Damping in all dimensions (currently it works only on the y-axis).</li>
</ul>
